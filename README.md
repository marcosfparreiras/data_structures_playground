# About it
The idea of this project is to explore implementations and applications of a variety of Data Structures.

# How to run the Docker structure
Using the docker-compose, build the image:
```
docker-compose build
```
Then, run a container from the image:
```
docker-compose run app
```
At this point, you will have access to the shell inside the container, with the code present in the host.
